# Data Science from Scratch 

A repository implementing fundamental data science algorithms from first principles to build deeper understanding. 

## Current Projects

- **Neural Networks from Scratch**: Based on Andrej Karpathy's approach, implementing neural networks using only basic Python and NumPy
- **Principal Component Analysis (PCA) from Scratch**: Exploring dimensionality reduction without using high-level libraries

## Project Goals

This repository aims to deepen understanding of data science fundamentals by implementing algorithms from scratch, building intuition through code, and exploring the mathematical foundations.

## Potential Future Projects

- **ML Algorithms**: Linear/Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Clustering
- **Deep Learning**: CNNs, RNNs, Transformers
- **Statistical Methods**: Bayesian modeling, Time series analysis
